# 📧 Spam Email Detection using Machine Learning

This project is a simple and effective **Spam Email Detection** system built using **Python** and **Scikit-learn**. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify messages as **spam** or **ham (not spam)** based on their content.

The model is trained on sample data using the **TF-IDF vectorizer** and **Multinomial Naive Bayes** classifier. This is a beginner-friendly machine learning project suitable for academic submissions or personal learning.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** – for data handling  
- **Scikit-learn** – for ML modeling  
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** – for visualization  
- **TF-IDF Vectorizer** – for converting text to features

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. A sample dataset of text messages is created, each labeled as `spam` or `ham`.
2. The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
3. Messages are converted into numerical features using **TF-IDF Vectorizer**.
4. A **Multinomial Naive Bayes** model is trained on the training data.
5. The model is tested on unseen data and evaluated using accuracy score and confusion matrix.
6. The user can enter custom messages to check whether they're predicted as spam or not.

## 🧪 Sample Output

```

🔍 Accuracy: 1.0

📨 Sample Predictions:
SPAM ➜ You've been selected for a free gift card!
HAM ➜ Hi mom, just checking in.
SPAM ➜ Urgent: Account will be suspended if not verified
HAM ➜ Let's meet at the library at 4 PM

````

> Note: Accuracy is 100% on sample data. Use larger datasets for realistic evaluation.

## ✅ How to Run

1. Install required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
````

2. Run the script:

```bash
python spam_email_detector.py
```

3. Check output in terminal and generated confusion matrix image.

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Use larger real-world dataset (like [Kaggle's Spam Collection](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset))
* Save and load model with `joblib` or `pickle`
* Build a GUI using Tkinter or deploy via Flask web app
